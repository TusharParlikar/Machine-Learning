# 🌙 Dark Theme Chapters (Markdown Format)

This folder contains **Markdown (.md) versions** of all Jupyter notebooks from the main `chapters/` folder.

## 🎯 Why This Folder Exists?

**Problem**: GitHub renders Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) with a **white background** regardless of your theme settings, making them hard to read in dark mode.

**Solution**: These **Markdown files (.md)** render beautifully with **GitHub's dark theme** - code blocks have proper syntax highlighting and the background adapts to your theme preference!

## 📁 Contents

All 4 chapters have been converted to Markdown format:

| Chapter | Markdown File | Topics Covered |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **Chapter 01** | [01_NumPy_Foundations.md](01_NumPy_Foundations.md) | NumPy arrays, indexing, slicing, broadcasting, vectorization |
| **Chapter 02** | [02_Pandas_DataManipulation.md](02_Pandas_DataManipulation.md) | DataFrame, Series, data cleaning, groupby, merging |
| **Chapter 03** | [03_Matplotlib_Visualization.md](03_Matplotlib_Visualization.md) | Plotting, subplots, customization, multiple datasets |
| **Chapter 04** | [04_ScikitLearn_MachineLearning.md](04_ScikitLearn_MachineLearning.md) | ML models, train/test split, classification, regression, pipelines |

## 🎨 Benefits of Markdown Version

✅ **Dark theme friendly** - Code blocks render with syntax highlighting in your preferred theme  
✅ **Faster loading** - No need to render interactive notebook components  
✅ **Easy navigation** - Markdown is simple and clean  
✅ **All content preserved** - Code, output, explanations all included  
✅ **GitHub-optimized** - Perfect rendering on GitHub's interface  

---

## 📝 What's Included?

Each `.md` file contains:
- ✅ All markdown explanations (theory, concepts, examples)
- ✅ All Python code cells with syntax highlighting
- ✅ All code outputs (text output, data frames, statistics)
- ✅ Complete section structure and table of contents

**Note**: Interactive features (running code, modifying cells) are not available in Markdown. For that, use the original `.ipynb` files in the `chapters/` folder.

---

## 🔄 How These Were Created

These Markdown files were automatically generated from the original Jupyter notebooks using a Python conversion script (`convert_to_markdown.py`).

The conversion preserves:
- All markdown cells → Direct conversion to Markdown
- All code cells → Wrapped in \`\`\`python code blocks
- All outputs → Wrapped in \`\`\` output blocks
