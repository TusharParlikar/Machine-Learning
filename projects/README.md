## 🎯 Learning Path

**Complete projects in order!** Each builds on previous skills:

1. **Project 01** → Learn to clean messy data (foundation for everything)
2. **Project 02** → Visualize patterns (understand before modeling)
3. **Project 03** → Build classification models (binary/multiclass prediction)
4. **Project 04** → Build regression models (continuous value prediction)
5. **Project 05** → Explore unsupervised learning (clustering, PCA)
6. **Project 06** → Integrate everything (capstone project)

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Pick Project 01 (start here!)
2. Download suggested dataset from Kaggle
3. Follow step-by-step tasks with TODOs
4. Check success criteria
5. Move to next project

## 📊 Suggested Datasets

All projects use free Kaggle datasets:
- **Titanic** (classification): https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic
- **House Prices** (regression): https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques
- **Mall Customers** (clustering): https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial
